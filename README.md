# WebStorm Idiomatic.js Formatter

This is a configuration file for WebStorm that enables reformatting JavaScript to [the Idiomatic.js style](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js).

## Installation

1. Quit WebStorm.
2. [Determine the location of your Webstorm configuration.](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/help/project-and-ide-settings.html) You're looking for the `codestyles` directory.
3. Copy the `Idiomatic.xml` file to the `codestyles` directory. The following command will pull this down for you when run within `codestyles`:

```console
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techpeace/webstorm-idiomaticjs-formatter/master/Idiomatic.xml
```

4. Launch WebStorm, and head to Preferences > Editor > JavaScript.
5. Set "Scheme" to "Idiomatic".

You're all set! Now you can run Code > Reformat Code from the menu to automatically reformat your code to the Idiomatic.js style.
